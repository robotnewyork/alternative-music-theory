# Cables

Nowadays, it's quite possible to have a basic music studio without any special cables other than regular computer cables connected to a pair of headphones. However, once you have any outboard gear, even studio monitors or a MIDI controller, you will need to know at least the basics of the different types of cables and what they are used for.

## Audio Cables (TS / TRS)

The most common type of audio cable in a studio are 1/4" TS (tip-sleeve) and TRS (tip-ring-sleeve) cables. 1/8" are also common. These cables are used to transmit audio signals and the 1/4" variety are common with guitars, keyboards, headphones, mixers and studio monitors. The 1/8" variety are sometimes used with headphones and "boutique" synths. There are [common adapters](https://www.amazon.com/1-4-8-adapter/s?k=1+4+to+1+8+adapter) to turn a 1/8" end into a 1/4" and vice-versa.
