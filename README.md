# alternative-music-theory
There are many resources designed to teach different aspects of making music, mostly based on traditional approaches to music theory. This project provides an alternative approach to learning many of the same concepts in a more holistic manner. If you're tired of the same old structures and just want to make your own music, Alternative Music Theory may be right for you.

# Introduction

The standard approach<sup>1</sup> to learning "music", both historically and even the primary approach taught today, is generally focused on physically playing a "standard" instrument like piano or violin. Students begin by learning to play simple songs on an instrument, expecting to progress through more complicated pieces over time, meanwhile learning "theory" that roughly correlates to the ideas behind the types of pieces they are playing. Periodically there may be live recitals, where students can showcase their progress. Eventually they may incorporate additional instruments. Even later, generally, they may begin studying the compositional techniques used by composers, and begin composing their own pieces. This approach is based on a tradition that evolved over the last millenium, primarily in Europe with strong ties to Chistendom<sup>2</sup>. This is what is referred to when people say "classically trained". One benefit is that musicians brought up in this method can quickly learn to play in many popular styles, although sometimes having to bend or break some rules to fit their way of thinking<sup>3</sup>.

The standard approach can work well for many students, but I offer a number of criticisms that will be explored more deeply below:

- Students were expected to start young - beginner pieces are often nursery rhymes or simple children's songs, which may turn off students who begin learning at a later age, who may already feel left behind
- Focused on one-on-one or small group tutoring
- Myopic in terms of alternative styles or genres - jazz is seen as "add-on" or extension and rock a begrudgingly accepted third-party mod. Other styles like electronic music, Indian classic music or gamelan competing products that are generally ignored.
- Focus on performing first and composing second may not align with goals of modern musicmakers
- Can lag behind the times in terms of modern music and technology - no addressing of studio equipment or gear like reverb, delay, compressors, equalizers, etc.
- Concepts of "composer", "performer" and "engineer" are distinct (often the recording aspect is completely absent)

I propose an alternative approach that may work better for some students today who are interested in creating and recording modern music.


Since at least the 1960s musicians interesting in recording have needed to understand all three aspects of recorded music: composition, performance and engineering.  More recently a trend of blurring the lines between the three aspects has come into fashion, with the performance and recording understood as part of the composition itself. Perhaps the "performance" is done completely within a computer program, or the "recording" is the output of this program to a digital audio file. 

Today, this is a very common and legitimate way music is made; however, the standard cirriculum ignores this. This project is meant for aspiring musicians who are interested in all aspects of making music, including composition, performance and electronic recording. It is designed to expediate the process of making music without alienating them with archiac music theory trivia or waiting until they've spent years mastering their scales before learning how to actually record it with a DAW.

# Music Theory

Pitch/frequency from rubber band, pipe, string.
Humans can hear frequencies from around 20hz to 20khz.
Half=octave up, double=octave down. Pitch class = all pitches that correspond to the same pitch letter.
A perfect fifth consists of two pitches with a frequency ratio of 3:2, and generating twelve successive perfect fifths in this way *nearly* results in a return to the pitch class of the starting note. (explain temperaments later)
Define interval
Whole step, half step.
The major scale is the scale that Western music theory is based on, and is 8 notes spanning an octave with intervals W-W-H-W-W-W-H.
Starting on C, the major scale results in C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C, using no sharp or flat note names, and all white keys on the piano.
Minor scale

Building chords
Major
minor (harmonic, melodic, natural)
7th (maj/min)
6th
etc... 
show different symbols for diminished, jazz vs. rock vs classical
Key signatures
other scales = blues, bebop, altered
inversions, slash chords

Rhythm
Rhythm can be a bit trickier to explain, since it is trying to codify and describe subjective feelings humans have when listening to music. 
Beat
Measure/bar
Time signatures

Terms and ligatures (dotted notes, stems, pizzacato, accent types)
legato
staccato
ritard
accelerando
fermata
coda
repeat 
clef/grand staff (treble clef=G clef, bass clef=F clef)

etc.

1. By "standard approach" I mean the typical formal education method used in North American and European primary schools, and what people generally mean when they use the phrase "music lessons", "music tutor", etc.
2. [Adam Neely - Music Theory and White Supremacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr3quGh7pJA) - Don't get scared by the video title - it is a good overview of some of the problems with the standard approach. For example, Neely suggests we replace the term "music theory" with "the harmonic style of 18th century European musicians".
3. For example, "blue" notes and the concept of "swing" in jazz and blues.
