## Studio Rules

* No food, drink or smoking.
* Be careful not to blow speakers/monitors. When plugging in or turning on any gear, make sure its volume is turned down or monitors are turned off. At the beginning of a studio session, power up everything before the monitors. At the end of your session, turn off your monitors first then power down the rest of your gear. Don't have volumes too high and be careful when playing sub bass and/or distortion.
* Use only [console tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QDEQJM). Don't use any duct tape or masking tape on cables or hardware as it will get everything sticky.
