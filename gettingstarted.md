# Getting Started

Making computer music today may seem overwhelming, and it may be hard to know how to get started. [David Lynch advocates to get a setup and be patient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHhf76z6BkM). Fortunately, to make music with a computer in this day and age there are plenty of quality free and inexpensive tools so the primary cost is time and effort; however, there are no substitutes for either.

There are many paths to success, but here is one recommended roadmap:

1. Determine your passion - There are many styles of music and ways to be musically creative. Do you want to focus on composing? Or perhaps performing an instrument? Are you interested in experimenting with sound design, or perfecting your mixing and mastering skills? The options are endless, and your choice will also likely change over time and your process will adjust accordingly.
2. Get a setup - This may include [building a dedicated space like a home studio](/studiotips.md), or just installing some software on a laptop. The idea here is to make it easy and fun to achieve your goals. [Experiment with different DAWs](/daws.md), and once you choose the right one for you, configure it to maximize comfort (macros, color schemes, organize samples, etc). When buying gear, don't overlook things like high quality monitors (both speakers and visual monitors), desk, chair, a nice mouse and [shortcut keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KTZDP3Y). A high quality [desk](https://zaorstudiofurniture.com/product/miza-x2/) and chair are ideal but remember that plenty of your favorite tracks were made with less than you have now.
3. Join a community - Whether it be an online forum or real world group of performers, it is important to find like-minded people. Great musicians aren't incubated in a vaccuum. Besides just sharing knowledge and helping each other fill specific roles, you will develop friendships and encourage each other to be more determined and creative. 
4. Progress iteratively - Don't get discouraged when you aren't shredding after one day, one year or even one decade. For most of us, this is a lifelong passion and we can expect to make incremental progress. Learn how to practice and spend your time effectively.
