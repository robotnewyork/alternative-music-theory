# DAWs

A [DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) is often the central hub of a software-based music workflow. 

## Choosing a DAW

There are many DAWs to choose from, each with its own pros and cons. Some are geared towards specific genres of music (like Ableton with electronic music or FL Studio with electronic and hip-hop), while others like Cubase and Pro Tools and more general. FL studio emphasizes piano roll while Cubase is favored by many film composers for its sheet music view. I encourage you to try out various options and see which DAW connects with your workflow.
